Problem to be solved and Motivation:

As per an article posted by Fortune in May 2016, based on data from Federal Reserve, American's credit card debt was set to hit $1 trillion in 2016. That was a level not seen untill the all time high of $1.08 trillion in July 2008. In tough economic times, where people are faced with layoffs, they are forced to pay with their credit cards to buy essentials like food, medicare and housing rents. As they debts rises, they find it harder to keep up with their debt payments. To overcome losses, banks impose an interest on the debt payments which force people to get looped into a debt cycle. The dataset to be used in this project is about credit card issuers in Taiwan who faced the cash and credit debt crisis. In order to increase their market share, credit card companies over issued cash and credit cards to unqualified appliants who ended up accumulating credit and cash-card debts. It is therefore crucial for banks to develop risk management practices to predict business performance or individual customer's credit risk and to reduce the damage and uncertainity. Data mining techniques can be employed to forecast the probability of a payment default based on past payment practices of the client.
