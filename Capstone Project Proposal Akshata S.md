##Problem to be solved and Motivation:
As per an article posted by Fortune in May 2016, based on data from Federal Reserve, American's credit card debt was set to hit $1 trillion in 2016. That was a level not seen untill the all time high of $1.08 trillion in July 2008. In tough economic times, where people are faced with layoffs, they are forced to pay with their credit cards to buy essentials like food, medicare and housing rents. As they debts rises, they find it harder to keep up with their debt payments. To overcome losses, banks impose an interest on the debt payments which force people to get looped into a debt cycle. The dataset to be used in this project is about credit card issuers in Taiwan who faced the cash and credit debt crisis. In order to increase their market share, credit card companies over issued cash and credit cards to unqualified appliants who ended up accumulating credit and cash-card debts. It is therefore crucial for banks to develop risk management practices to predict business performance or individual customer's credit risk and to reduce the damage and uncertainity. Data mining techniques can be employed to forecast the probability of a payment default based on past payment practices of the client.

##Client:
Card issuing-banks in Taiwan are seeking to under stand their client payment patterns so as to ascertain whether their next payments would be defaults. Having forecasted payment defaulters will help banks ensure better risk management practices.

A lot of individual companies produce and collect a huge volume of data on an everyday basis. Deriving meaningful insights out of the data collected is a challenge that most companies face. With the data mining techniques that I would be using in this project, initial exploration and analysis would help comapanies identify credit risks, fraudulent transactions, and understand their customer demographics.

##Data:
The data will be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients# 

##Approach:
Initially, I wish to to do some exploratory data analysis to get an idea of the distribution of the different variables. Data wrangling techniques would be applied as learnt from the course. I will then build different models and compare the probabilities. The results would be effectively conveyed via Data Visualizations.

##Deliverables:
The capstone project will produce a Presentation, a report and the Python Code in the form of a iPython Notebook that will be submitted into my Github repository.
